Things to add as future scope / improvements
1. Accuracy of data
	- Special occassions do not match across locations
	- Rain advisory data does not match
2. Clarity of data
	- 'Low turn out' mentioned, but event is not mentioned
	- Fasting day mentioned, justification not given
3. Menu items should be common for processing
	- Items like Varan, Dal fry written in 4 different ways
	- Spelling mistakes are very common
4. Individual menu item count missing
	- Watermelon is often in demand during summers, data of individual consumption should be provided.
5. Change of model with more data
	- Implementing a tree-based model will be more accurate when we have more/accurate data.
6. Data processing
	- For this application, processing data weekly in batches should be good enough rather than having AI process data as and when it is fed.
	- A neural network based algorithm can be implemented to capture complex relationships.
	- Store/Add data to a database to avoid manually uploading files
